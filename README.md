I developed an endless runner game as part of my college project, centered around the theme of 'Use of Gaming in Education.' This interactive game is designed to enhance learning by integrating educational challenges into gameplay. When players encounter obstacles, they are presented with questions, and upon answering correctly, they receive an additional lifeline. By combining entertainment with education, this game fosters an engaging and effective learning experience, demonstrating the potential of gaming as a tool for educational advancement.
